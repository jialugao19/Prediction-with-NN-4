    """
    A 64-bit permutation object.
    It permute the given index to another index.
    This can be used as a shuffler for the data loader.

    This is faster by calling with numpy integer array rather than per element.

    :param length: The length of the permutation.
        Non-negative and no more than 2**63-1.
    :param seed_val: The seed value for the permutation.
        Non-negative.
